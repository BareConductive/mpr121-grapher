# Bare Conductive MPR121 grapher

Processing sketch that graphs capacitive electrode data from the [Bare Conductive Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/touch-board/) or [Bare Conductive Pi Cap](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/pi-cap/) over time. 

## Requirements

* [Processing](http://www.processing.org/download) 3.0+ with [controlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) library 2.2.5+ installed and [oscp5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/) library 0.9.8+ installed
* Processing's instructions for installing libraries are available [here](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/)
* [DataStream](https://github.com/BareConductive/mpr121/tree/public/MPR121/Examples/DataStream) (running on [Bare Conductive Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/touch-board/))
 

## Install

1. Close the Processing IDE if you have it open.
1. Download the [.zip](https://github.com/BareConductive/mpr121-grapher/archive/public.zip) or clone the repository to your local machine - if downloading the .zip, extract the contents somewhere that suits you.
1. Take the **mpr121_grapher** folder and move it to **Processing Sketchbook Folder**. This will be different for each operating system: 

	**Windows**
	
	Libraries\\Documents\\Processing
	
	or
	
	My Documents\\Processing	
	
	**Mac**
	
	Documents/Processing
	
	**Linux (Ubuntu)**
	
	Home/Processing


	If this folder does not exist, create it first.
1. Reopen the Processing IDE - you should now be able to open the sketch in the **File -> Sketchbook** menu.
